PREFACE.

Nssx'r after the Ecclesiastical History of
Beda, and the Saxon Chronicle, the principa!

, source of early English History is the chronicle

grafted on that of Marianus Scotus by Florence,
a monk of Worcester.

The few particulars that have reached our
time of the Life of Marianus, are derived from
the notices contained in the chronicle as com-
posed by Florence, viz. that he was a native
of Ireland, born in the year 1028; that in 1056
he forsook the land of his birth, and became a
monk in the Scottish cloister of St. Martin at
Cologne3 that in 1059 he was ordained priest at
Wiirzburg‚ and then lived as a recluse at Fulda,
which place he left in the year 1069 for Mentz,
where, in the monastery of St. Alban the Mat-tyr,
he died about the year 1086.ι

As the object here in view requires but a
slight notice of MarianuS, it will suffice to add,
that the work compiled by him, into which
Florence inserted his chronicle of English affairS,
is a general chronicle from the creation of the
world to his own timeS. On the supposition
that the Dionysiam era of the birth of Christ
is fixed too late by twenty-two years, Marianus
added a double chronology to his work, one

¹ His chronicle⁶is continued abbot of St. Disibod, in the dio-
to the year 1200, by Dodechin, cese of Treves.
