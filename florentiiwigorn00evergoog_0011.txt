and place spoken os by Ordericus Vitalis as a
contemporary of Bishop Wulfstan.

After due praise bestowed on the work of
William of PoitierS, Orderic adds: ‘ Guy, bishop
of AmienS, also published a poem, in which,
imitating Maro and PapiniuS, in recording the
deeds of heroes», he has described the battle of
Senlac, reproaching and condemning Harold,
but praising and magnifying william: He
then goes on to say, that ‘ a monk of Worcester
named John, venerable alike for his morals and
learning, faithfully extracted from William of
Poitiers and Guy of Amiens that which he
added to the chronicles of Marianus ScotuS‚
concerning William the Conqueror and his sonS,
William Rufus andHenry, and the events which
took place under them, until his (Orderic's) own
time3 and that the said John, following the
example of Marianus, had recorded the transac-
tions of nearly a hundred years, which, at the
desire of Bishop Wulfstan, he had inserted into
the above-mentioned chronicleS, in which he
communicated many things relating to the Ro-
mans, FrankS, GermanS, and other nations! ²
