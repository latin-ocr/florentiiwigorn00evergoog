Now it is to be observe'd, that NVulfstan died
in the year 1095, that is, twenty-three years·
before the death of Florence himself, conse-
quently while the latter was busily employed
on the task of incorporating his chronicle of
English affairs with the pages of Marianus( It
must also be borne in mind that Orderic was
not only a learned and well-informed man sor
his time, but that he was by birth an English-
man, and one by no means indifferent to the
credit of his native country. Had it then been
the joint work of Marianus and Florence to
which, by desire of Wulfstan, John appended
his own learned labourS, is it at all probable
that Orderic the Englishman would have desig-
nated it as the work of MarianuS, omitting all
mention of the share taken in it by his fellow-
countryman, Florence of Worcester? More
probable seems the conclusion, that during Wulf·
stan's lifetime, and while Florence was engaged
on his work, the labours os John were bestowed
on the original chronicle of MarianuS, and that
the manuscript containing those labours is no
longer known to exist. At all eventS,5f any
part of any of the extant copies is the work of
this John, it cannot be the continuation, and
hardly any portion subsequent to 1095, the year
of NVulfstan's death. In fine, can any part of
any copy of the chronicle of Marianus Scotus
embodying Florence of Worcester be pointed
out as answering the description given by
Orderic of the labours of the monk J obn?
