In support of the foregoing view os the case,
may be added, that, so far from exhibiting any
matter derived from Guy of AmienS,--a writer
remarkably diffuse and circumstantial,— the
chronicles‚ whether of Marianus or Florence,
are ‘particularly meagre and void of detail in⁶
what they impart relative to william, duke or
count of Normandy, and the battle of Senlac or
Hastings.

The Continuation to the year 1295 is from a
manuscript belonging to Corpus Christi College,
Cambridge. This Continuati0n‚ from its com-
mencement to the year 1152, consists of a mere
transcript from the chronicle of Henry os Hun-
tingdon and his continuator. This portion it
has been deemed unnecessary to reprint. What
follows is a transcript, by the same hand, of the
chronicle of John de Taxster‚ a monk of Bury
· St. Edmund’s‚ as far as the year 1265 inclusive,
when the manuscripts of that chronicler termi-
nate. The remainder is a compilation by a
monk of the same place‚-probably the scribe
himselfi—-as, among the events which he records,
those relating to Bury occupy a considerable
space.

Though De Taxster, like other monastic
chroniclers‚ began his work with the Creation,
it is only from the year 1152, where it is taken
up by the monk of Bury, as a continuation to
Florence‚ that it commences to be of any in-
terest3 otherwise the portion from the landing
os the Germanic tribes in Britain would have
been given, as an appendix to the present
edition.
