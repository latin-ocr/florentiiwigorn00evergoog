1'. MS. Corp. Chr. 0011. Oxon. In large solie,
of the twelfth century, written by the same hand
till towards the, end. Prefixed to it (besides the
lists of prelates and royal genealogies given in
the present edition) are lists of kings of France,
dukes of N ormandy, the seventy disciples, etc.
It ends abruptly at the year 1140, where it 1188
suffered mutilation.¹ This manuscript, though
occasionally less comprehensive than those to be
hereafter mentioned, may, nevertheless, 118 18-
garded as the purest 81111 11881 extant. In the
margin are written, in another and, of course,
later hand, many notices relating to the succes-
sions and deaths of bishops and 81111018, which,
·when not evidently copied from William of
Malmesbury (De Gestis Pontificum), will 118
found in the form of foot-notes to the present
edition. It is matter of regret, that, in the
insertion of these 11011088, 111018 regard 1188 1101
118811, paid to dates. 111 8 few instances the
same entry is repeated under different dates,
under one in the text and another in the margin.
These notices refer for ‚the most part to the sees
of Hereford, Chester, and Lichfield. This
manuscript, which forms the basis of the pre-
sent text, formerly belonged to the abbey of
Worcester.
